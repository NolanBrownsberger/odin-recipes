  <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This quick and easy recipe will leave you with a stockpile of meatballs worth their weight 
      in gold. This is a family recipe that has been around for at least one generation, so 
      I am completely biased in saying that these are the finest meatballs I have ever tasted. The
      recipe is pretty straightforward, so good luck even though you won't need it. Additionally, 
      If you do go the "chef mike" route, I would heavily suggest that you leave enough space 
      between the individual meatballs in the casserole dish.

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3/4 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1/4 pound ground pork</li>
      <li>1 cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1/2 cup parmesan cheese, grated</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon parsley, minced</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
      <li>2 beaten eggs</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather ingredients and a large mixing bowl.</li>
      <li>Incorporate all ingredients inside of the bowl and mix until homogenous.</li>
      <li>Roll meatballs to your desired size and place them in a casserole dish.</li>
      <li>
        Either cover the casserole dish and cook in the microwave(trust me) or cook 
        the meatballs in a pot of tomato sauce. Cook until they reach an internal temperature 
        of 155 degrees Fahrenheit.
      </li>
    </ol>
