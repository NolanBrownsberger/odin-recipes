      <h3 class="header">Description</h3>
        <p>
          This recipe is a copycat of Olive Garden's Paste e Fagioli recipe, which was scraped from the 
          web long ago, so it is probably plagiarized. But the secret ingredient here must be crime because 
          this soup is truly scrumptious. 
        </p>
        <p>
          While the ingredient list may look intimidating, this recipe has been so eloquently described by my 
          mother as "really easy," and it really is! Once the beef and veggies have been prepared in a 
          skillet, all you need to do is put all the ingredients in a slow cooker and wait. This recipe makes 
          a large batch that will keep your fridge stocked with delicious goodness.

      <h3 class="header">Steps</h3>
      <div class="list">
        <ol>
          <li>Gather and prepare the various ingredients.</li>
          <li>Cook ground beef in a large skillet. Once the meat has browned, drain the excess fat.</li>
          <li>Add onion, carrot, celery, and garlic to the pan for 10 minutes at a lower heat.</li>
          <li>Transfer the contents from the skillet, along with the rest of the ingredients, to a slow cooker set to low heat.</li>
          <li>Leave contents cooking for 6-8 hours. Prepare pasta in a separate pot during this time.</li>
          <li>
            Once the soup and pasta are completed, everything is finished. At this point, you can either store
            the pasta and soup separately or incorporate the noodles now. Enjoy!
