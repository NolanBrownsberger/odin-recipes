# The Odin Project - Recipes

## Description
Enjoy a few of my mom's staple recipes through this small html based project. Expect a basic index/homepage that links to three different recipe pages. It displays the understanding of the boilerplate html layout along with the syntax for many introductory elements. 

## Features Present
- an organized web project directory
- relative linking path elements between .html files
- heading and paragraph elements
- image elements with standard attributes
- ordered and unordered list elements
- organized git usage and commit history
- some very primitive css
